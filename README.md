## General info
Initially planned as a platform that caters to landlord and tenant convenience, our project has shifted slightly throughout the development stages and now serves as an accessible resource for agencies that monitor landlord, tenant and unit information. Our web page allows users to search through existing units based on specified criteria, examine contracts, availability and rent statistics, view upcoming appointments with property managers, as well as add, update and delete tenant information. We envision this project to serve as a central platform for organizations overlooking tenancy relationships, such as the BC Residential Tenancy Branch of the provincial government, to have access to a dynamic bank of information about landlord/tenant relationships, unit characteristics and upcoming appointments.
